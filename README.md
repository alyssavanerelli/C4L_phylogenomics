# C4L busco phylogenomics pipeline

1. Create conda environment
- First we will need to make a conda environment to run `busco` and `busco_phylogenomics`
- To do this you will make an environment using the provided [`busco.yml` file](https://github.com/alyssavanerelli/C4L_phylogenomics/blob/main/busco.yml)
- If you have never used conda before, there will be some initial steps that you can follow [here]()

```
conda env create -f busco.yml
```
